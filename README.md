<h2> What is Containerization?</h2>

Containerization is defined as a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolated user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system (OS). A container is essentially a fully packaged and portable computing environment

<h2>Benefits</h2>
Containerization offers significant benefits to developers and development teams. Among these are the following:
<ol>
  <li>Portability</li>
  <li>Agility</li>

<h2>Types</h2>
The Open Container Initiative (OCI), established in June 2015 by Docker and other industry leaders, is promoting common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology. Because of this, the OCI is helping to broaden the choices for open source engines.<br />
Docker is one of the most well-known and highly used container engine technologies, but it is not the only option available. The ecosystem is standardizing on containerd and other alternatives like CoreOS rkt, Mesos Containerizer, LXC Linux Containers, OpenVZ, and crio-d.
